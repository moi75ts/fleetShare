I would like these features in the starSector API

Set  campaign clock -> sets the clock to the provided timestamp
playerPickedUpCargoPods -> event listener
reportFleetSpawner fires multiple times per fleet spawn -> i would like only once
I would like a submarket.setTag() and a submarket.getTag();


the starting ships have a weird spec id
like my apogee I got from starting the game has a specid of 938f
while I would expect some apogee_Hull, this issue only appears on starting ships
